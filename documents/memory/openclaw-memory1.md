OpenClaw Memory Architecture
A multi-layered memory system for OpenClaw agents that combines structured storage, semantic search, and cognitive patterns to give your agent persistent, reliable memory.

The problem: AI agents wake up fresh every session. Context compression eats older messages mid-conversation. Your agent forgets what you told it yesterday.

The solution: Don't rely on one approach. Use the right memory layer for each type of recall.

Why Not Just Vector Search?
Vector search (embeddings) is great for fuzzy recall — "what were we talking about regarding infrastructure?" — but it's overkill for 80% of what a personal assistant actually needs:

"What's my daughter's birthday?" → Structured lookup (instant, exact)
"What did we decide about the database?" → Decision fact (instant, exact)
"What happened last week with the deployment?" → Semantic search (fuzzy, slower)
This architecture uses each tool where it's strongest.

Unified Search: memory_search
One tool, four backends, one call:

memory_search("what did we decide about the database?")
        │
        ├── continuity  — semantic vector search over conversation archives (384d embeddings)
        ├── facts       — structured entity/key/value lookup + FTS5 (facts.db)
        ├── files       — workspace document vector search (file-vec index)
        └── lcm         — full-text search over lossless messages + summaries (lcm.db FTS5)
        │
        ▼
    Combined results — one response, all memory systems
All four backends run in parallel — no latency penalty from adding more. Results are formatted by type:

Backend	What it finds	Best for
continuity	Past conversations (semantic similarity + temporal re-ranking)	"What did we discuss about X?"
facts	Structured facts, preferences, decisions (exact + fuzzy)	"What's my daughter's birthday?"
files	Workspace documents, project files, notes	"Where did I document the deploy process?"
lcm	Raw messages + compressed summaries from lossless history	"What command did I run yesterday?"
When to go deeper
memory_search covers 90% of recall needs. For the other 10% — when you need to drill into a compressed summary, trace a decision chain, or recover exact commands from a long session — use the dedicated LCM tools:

lcm_grep — targeted regex/full-text search (same as the lcm backend, but standalone)
lcm_describe — inspect a specific summary's metadata
lcm_expand_query — spawn a sub-agent to traverse the DAG and answer questions from expanded context (~120s, for precision questions)
Configuration
# Search all backends (default)
memory_search(query: "database migration", systems: "continuity,facts,files,lcm")

# Search specific backends
memory_search(query: "Sascha's birthday", systems: "facts")
memory_search(query: "deployment steps", systems: "files,lcm")
The systems parameter defaults to continuity,facts,files,lcm. Pass a comma-separated subset to narrow scope.

Our setup: llama.cpp with nomic-embed-text-v2-moe at localhost:8082. All embedding consumers (continuity, semantic search, grepai) hit this single server. Zero API cost, 768d, multilingual.

Quick Start
1. Directory Structure
Create a memory/ directory in your OpenClaw workspace (the directory configured as your agent's working directory in openclaw.json). This is where daily journal files (YYYY-MM-DD.md), active-context.md, and heartbeat state live.

# Inside your OpenClaw workspace root (e.g. ~/clawd)
mkdir -p memory
2. Initialize facts.db
python3 scripts/init-facts-db.py
3. Seed Facts
python3 scripts/seed-facts.py
4. Configure Embeddings
For llama.cpp GPU (recommended):

# docker-compose.yml for dedicated embedding server
services:
  llama-embed:
    image: ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server
    container_name: llama-embed
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./models:/models:ro
    command: >
      llama-server
        -m /models/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe.Q6_K.gguf
        --embedding
        --pooling mean
        -c 2048
        -ngl 999
        --host 0.0.0.0
        --port 8080
5. Install Plugins
cd ~/.openclaw/extensions

# Core memory plugins (our forks)
git clone https://github.com/coolmanns/openclaw-plugin-continuity.git
git clone https://github.com/coolmanns/openclaw-plugin-metabolism.git

# Upstream plugins
git clone https://github.com/CoderofTheWest/openclaw-plugin-stability.git

# Lossless context engine (replaces default compaction)
git clone https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw.git

# Optional: metacognitive stack
git clone https://github.com/CoderofTheWest/openclaw-metacognitive-suite.git
cp -r openclaw-metacognitive-suite/openclaw-plugin-contemplation .

# Install dependencies
for d in openclaw-plugin-* lossless-claw; do cd "$d" && npm install && cd ..; done
6. Configure in ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": [
      "openclaw-plugin-continuity",
      "openclaw-plugin-stability",
      "openclaw-plugin-metabolism",
      "openclaw-plugin-contemplation",
      "lossless-claw"
    ],
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-plugin-continuity": { "enabled": true },
      "openclaw-plugin-stability": { "enabled": true },
      "openclaw-plugin-metabolism": { "enabled": true },
      "lossless-claw": { "enabled": true }
    },
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "lossless-claw"
    }
  }
}
Note: The slots.contextEngine assignment is what activates LCM. Without it, lossless-claw loads as a regular plugin but never takes over context management.

7. Schedule Decay Cron (optional)
facts.db uses a Hebbian-inspired activation model: facts that get accessed frequently stay "hot," while unused facts gradually cool down. The decay cron runs nightly to age activation scores across all facts.

# Runs at 3 AM daily — adjusts activation tiers (Hot → Warm → Cool)
# Logs to persistent location (survives reboots)
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 3 * * * python3 ~/clawd/scripts/graph-decay.py >> ~/clawd/logs/graph-decay.log 2>&1") | crontab -
Note: The decay scoring columns (decay_score, activation, importance) exist in the schema but the ranking logic is still a stub — facts are stored and searched but decay doesn't yet influence search result ordering. This is on the roadmap (Task #93). The cron is safe to run now; it just won't affect behavior until the ranking integration is wired up.

Reference Hardware
Component	Spec
CPU	AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 — 16c/32t
RAM	32GB DDR5 (unified with GPU)
GPU	AMD Radeon 8060S — 96GB unified VRAM
Storage	1.9TB NVMe
The 96GB unified VRAM enables running large models without swapping. Smaller setups (8-16GB) work fine with llama.cpp alone.

Metacognitive Pipeline (v2.4)
Beyond storage and recall, the architecture includes a metacognitive loop that lets the agent learn from its own conversations:

Conversation → Metabolism (extract facts + gaps)
                    ↓                    ↓
              facts.db            pending-gaps.json
              (superseded_at        ↓
               invalidation)   Nightshift cron (23:00-08:00)
                                     ↓
                              Contemplation (3-pass over 24h)
                                     ↓
                              Growth Vectors (19 active)
                                     ↓
                              Crystallization (30+ day gate)
Metabolism — Anthropic Sonnet extracts facts, implications, and knowledge gaps. Metadata pre-filter strips 10+ noise patterns. Entity normalization via gazetteer. Writes to facts.db (with superseded_at invalidation) and forwards gaps via file queue.
Contemplation — Three-pass inquiry pipeline (explore → reflect → synthesize) triggered by nightshift cron. Each gap examined over ~24 hours.
Growth Vectors — 19 active vectors (deduped from 902 candidates via Jaccard similarity). Unified schema with area/direction/priority fields.
Crystallization — Promotes growth vectors to permanent character traits after 30+ days. Three-gate model: time + principle alignment + human approval. (Not yet installed — next after contemplation proven.)
Per-agent scoping: The entire metacognitive pipeline runs for the main agent only. Other agents (cron-agent, spiritual-dude) are silently skipped to prevent orphaned data.

Lossless Context Management (LCM)
The newest layer — and architecturally the most significant. Instead of OpenClaw's default "chop and forget" compaction, LCM preserves every message in an immutable SQLite store and builds a summary DAG during compaction.

How it works:

Every message (user, assistant, tool I/O) is stored in lcm.db with FTS5 indexing
When the context window fills, LCM creates leaf summaries (depth 0) from the oldest messages
As more summaries accumulate, they're merged into higher-level summaries (depth 1, 2, ...)
Context assembly walks the DAG to reconstruct the most relevant context per turn
Nothing is ever deleted — you can drill into any summary to recover the original messages
Search tools:

memory_search (lcm backend) — FTS5 search over messages and summaries, runs in parallel with other backends
lcm_grep — standalone regex or full-text search (same underlying query, more control)
lcm_describe — inspect a specific summary's metadata and content
lcm_expand — traverse the DAG to recover compressed detail
lcm_expand_query — delegated sub-agent answers questions from expanded context
Complementary to continuity: LCM handles within-session lossless context. Continuity handles cross-session archive and recall. They serve different timescales. Both are searchable through the same memory_search tool — continuity via semantic vectors, LCM via full-text search.

Config:

{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "lossless-claw"
    }
  }
}
Roadmap
Near-term (next 2-4 weeks)
LCM secrets scrubbing — Tool I/O is stored verbatim in lcm.db. API keys, tokens, and sensitive data in exec/read output land in the DB permanently. Need a scrubbing layer before storage.
Crystallization plugin (Task #92) — Install and configure the growth vector → permanent trait pipeline. Blocked on contemplation proving itself (first successful passes needed).
Hebbian decay implementation (Task #93) — decay_score, activation, importance columns exist in facts.db but the actual decay logic is a stub. Wire real decay into search ranking.
✅ Done: prependContext → prependSystemContext migration — Continuity and stability plugins now inject via prependSystemContext (system prompt space, not ingested by LCM DAG).

Mid-term (1-3 months)
Growth vector quality (Task #102) — Current extraction prompt produces operational noise as "insights." Need behavioral vs. operational separation. Metabolism pipeline v2 redesign.
Metabolism on lcm.db — Instead of extracting facts from compacted conversation snippets, metabolism could run session-end extraction against the full lossless record in lcm.db. Better input = better output.
Cross-session LCM queries — lcm_grep and lcm_expand_query with allConversations: true to search across every session the agent has ever had. The "perfect memory" use case.
Vision
Unified knowledge architecture — The LCM DAG as both conversation record AND knowledge graph. Growth vectors as DAG annotations. Facts as DAG-derived entities. One store, multiple views. The summary DAG already captures relationships between topics naturally — extracting them explicitly would close the loop between "what was discussed" and "what was learned."
